    Given the provided {context}, your task is to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on Bloom's Taxonomy. For each identified topic in the document, create MCQs for each level of Bloom's Taxonomy as follows:

        1) Remembering (Knowledge-based questions):
        - Ask factual questions that require recalling information from the context.
        - Sample question stems: Who, What, When, Where, Define, Identify, List, etc.
        
        2) Understanding (Comprehension-based questions):
        - Ask questions that require understanding the meaning, interpreting, exemplifying, summarizing, or inferring information from the context.
        - Sample question stems: Explain, Describe, Summarize, Illustrate, Interpret, etc.
        
        3) Applying (Application-based questions):
        - Ask questions that require applying information from the context to new situations or solving problems.
        - Sample question stems: How would you use/apply...? What would happen if...? Solve/Calculate, etc.
        
        4) Analyzing (Analysis-based questions):
        - Ask questions that require breaking down information into parts, finding patterns, identifying causes/reasons, and making inferences.
        - Sample question stems: Analyze, Differentiate, Categorize, Compare/Contrast, etc.
        
        5) Evaluating (Evaluation-based questions):
        - Ask questions that require making judgments, evaluating ideas or solutions, and justifying decisions based on the context.
        - Sample question stems: Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Argue for/against, etc.
        
        6) Creating (Synthesis-based questions):
        - Ask questions that require generating new ideas, products, or ways of viewing things based on the context.
        - Sample question stems: Design, Construct, Develop, Formulate, Propose, etc.

        Your output should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single MCQ with the following keys:
        - 'question': The MCQ question
        - 'options': A list of four answer options (A, B, C, D)
        - 'answer': The correct answer option (e.g., 'A')
        - 'level': The corresponding Bloom's Taxonomy level (e.g., 'Remembering', 'Understanding', etc.)
        **Important note:- my output should not contain input document and for each level (remembering, understanding, analyzing, creating, evaluating,applying) generate minimum of 6 questions maximum of 8 questions**
